### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Gaming / Utilities
- **Mobile:** We are making this app specifically to only be used on a mobile device. There are already websites for this, but considering this is an online PC game we feel it would be best to access this information on a mobile device.
- **Story:** Takes all the information about the game and displays it in different categories. User can click on a category and look at all the information that pertains to that category.
- **Market:** This app is made for anybody that plays or wants to play the game Valheim. It will be a great resource to have to ensure they have a wonderful experience playing the game. 
- **Habit:** User can use it as they see fit. If they want certain parts of the game to be a surprise then they can stay away from that category. They can also use it to look for certain items or to travel to certain biomes. 
- **Scope:** We want the Valheim community to have an easily accessible app where they can find all the information that pertains to the game. Considering there is so much to do and so much to find, the app can help them make sure that they get the full experience and locate everything there is in the world of Valheim.
